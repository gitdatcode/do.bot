## Does a bunch of stuff for the Slack group!

Since we got a lot of integrations going, we thought it'd be cool to just build an app and consolidate a lot of the custom things we wanted to make.

### Requirements
 - [node](http://nodejs.org)
 - [express](http://expressjs.com)
 - [body-parser (to parse the JSON)](https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser)
 - [request (simplified HTTP requests)](https://github.com/request/request)

Also go check out the [Slack API](http://api.slack.com) for more information.

### Future updates
 - global resource posting by Slack command: use `/resource` with your topic to submit resources from any channel.
 - get help with a problem: use `/whatevercommandhere` with your question to get help from more knowledgeable members.
